# Blender-Cabinets
This Blender Add-on was originally created to add a form of shelves (like the one from maya) to blender but duo to certain things, it is now mostly being used to readd the menu that existed
from old verisons of blender (2.79 and below)

if you notice some options missing it is usually because some options come from add-ons that exist in blender by default but are not enabled

Add-ons
----------------------------------
Mesh: Looptools

Add Curve: Extra Objects

Add Mesh: Extra Objects

Add Mesh: A.N.T Landscape

Add Curve: Tree Sapling Tree Gen

------------------------------------

and it will include some other useful things too that are more commonly used that will be added to the menu, such as things related to UV unwarping for example (which currently do exist)
