# Blender-Cabinets
This Blender Add-on was originally created to add a form of shelves (like the one from maya) to blender but duo to certain things, it is now mostly being used to readd the menu that existed
from old verisons of blender (2.79 and below)

and it will include more useful things too for things that are more commonly used in the menu, such as things related to UV unwarping for example
